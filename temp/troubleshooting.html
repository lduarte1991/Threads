				<strong>Problems viewing/making annotations?</strong><br>
				<p>Due to your personal browser privacy settings you may be able to see threads but not be able to do much of anything else at all!
				</p>
				<p>Follow the instructions below to figure out how to change your settings:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><a href='#safari-instructions'>Safari</a></li>
				<li><a href='#chrome-instructions'>Chrome</a></li>
				<li><a href='#firefox-instructions'>Firefox</a></li>
				<li><a href='#ie-instructions'>Internet Explorer</a></li>

			<h3 id="issue-2">When the page loads, edx seems to load correctly, I can see the threads, but nothing happens when I click on a thread or when I try to add a new one!</h3>

			<p>
			This will happen if you (1) disconnect from the internet after the page has loaded, (2) if you block third-party cookies and site-data to be stored in your browser, or (3) if our server is down.
			</p>
			<div style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">
			<p id="safari-instructions"><strong>Safari - </strong> Go to <strong>Safari &gt; Preferences</strong>. Under the <strong>Privacy</strong> tab you should see options for "Cookies and website data." The default is "Allow from websites I visit". Visiting this troubleshoot page should allow you to add the tool's site to the websites you've visited, so just refresh the edx page with the tool and it should now work. You'll have to visit this page again in the future if you run into problems. If you would like to prevent problems in the future, then select "Always allow" but be aware of security concerns from doing this.
			</p>
			<p id="chrome-instructions"><strong>Chrome - </strong> Chrome has a specific setting in the privacy options that will block third-party site data to be stored. To fix this, go to <strong>Chrome &gt; Preferences</strong> and this should open up a new Settings tab. Scroll to the bottom and click on the "Show advanced settings..." link. Find the "Privacy" section and hit the button marked "Content settings..." This should cause a pop up to appear and you should make sure that the option "Block third-party cookies and site data" is <em>deselected</em>.</p>
			<p id="firefox-instructions"><strong>Firefox - </strong> Firefox has a specific setting in the privacy options that will block third-party site data to be stored. To fix this, go to <strong>Firefox &gt; Preferences</strong> and this should open up a new Preferences tab. Select the "Privacy" section on the left sidebar. Under the "History" subsection should see a dropdown menu that says "Firefox will:" and here you should select the option "Use custom settings for history".  It should expand your options and now you should make sure that you Accept cookeis from sites and that for the "Accept third party cookies" options you select "Always" or "From visited".</p>
			<p id="ie-instructions"><strong>Internet Explorer -</strong> Open "Internet Options" and go to the "Privacy" tab. Hit the "Advanced" button below the slider and override your settings. Make sure that "Third Party" sessions and cookies are allowed.
			</p>
			</div>
			<p>If replies still do not load and you cannot make any new threads, then the server might be down. Notify your instructor and don't panic, we're on the case.
			</p>
			<h3>Still don't see your issue?</h3>
			<p>Go to the discussion board for your course and let us know what's wrong and we'll get on it as quickly as possible. Please be ready to give us information so that we are able to recreate your problem--in particular you should head over to <a href="http://whatsmyuseragent.com/">whatsmyuseragent.com</a> and copy over what your user agent string is at the top of the page. Don't fret, there are many ways to work around issues and the tool is still in development so any issues you encounter will help us catch them and fix them for future courses. Thanks for your input!</p>
